KATA TIME! Fizz Buzz... QIX?!
Module 1 - Week 3
Assignment Instructions
This week we are changing things up, we are only giving you one test, you have to write the rest on your own. We are taking the old Fizz Buzz kata out for a ride, but we are adding a new feature to develop: Qix. The functionality you must test out for FizzBuzzQix is as follows:

Given an integer, return a String representation of that integer: 1 -> "1" and 2 -> "2" for example.
Given an integer that is a multiple of 3, return a String that contains the word "Fizz".
Given an integer that is a multiple of 5, return a String that contains the word "Buzz".
Given an integer that is a multiple of 7, return a String that contains the word "Qix".
If multiple words are used, add them in order of Fizz, Buzz, then Qix. For example: 105 -> FizzBuzzQix
Deadline and Grading Criteria
The deadline for this project is Monday, September 28th, at 9:30am. If the project is not complete or not pushed up to GitHub at that time it will be evaluated as an Incomplete project.

This is a Pass/Fail assignment, the assignment will be considered passing if it meets the following criteria:

Uses Git and GitHub to push complete assignment to GitHub before due date.
The code compiles. (No red squiggly underlines!)
All acceptance tests pass. I will be adding the acceptance tests after you turn in the project, so please keep the class, method name, and return type the same as the stub method I provide.
If your project doesn't meet these criteria at the deadline, it will be marked as Needs Improvement.

If your project is evaluated as Incomplete or Needs Improvement we will let you know and give you feed back on what needs to change to help move it to a passing project. You will receive a new deadline of Friday, October 2nd, at 9:30 to re-submit your project by pushing changes to GitHub.
We will evaluate your project with the same criteria as the first submission and this evaluation will be the final grade for this assessment.
